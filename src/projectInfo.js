const eatlyText = `Eatly is a great way to quickly and easily plan events with your friends, 
  such as a group lunch or dinner. As the host, simply enter your desired criteria, such as type 
  of restaurant, location, price range, and event time. Then, invite your guests and they will 
  receive the invite via your choosing of email or text. Eatly will generate a list of choices 
  based on your created event and send the options to all your invitees, for swipe style voting.
  When everyone has voted, the final location and details will be sent to everyone.
  No more endless group emails or texting threads, gather everyone's preference's in a fun way 
  and have your event planned with a few simple invites and votes`;
